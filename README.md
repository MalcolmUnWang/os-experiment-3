# os-experiment-3
For this lab, I am going to implement interprocess comunication in three way by C language. 
## Compile
You can easily compile these C language file by command:
<pre><code> gcc -o name name.c </code></pre>
## Running
To run the compiled program, you can just input the name and normally a string behind it. Noted that in FIFO. the server program do not have to add one string message behind it since the message is input by the cilent. But normally you just input the below command to run the program.
<pre><code> ./name EveryStringYouWannaInputButJustOneAndNotTooLong </code></pre>
## Anyway
Normally, just my assistant teacher will see this and he definitly know the above things. So the README.md file is just for appearance. :)
